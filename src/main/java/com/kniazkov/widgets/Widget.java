/**
 * Abstract base class representing a user interface element (widget).
 * <p>
 *     A {@code Widget} is a server-side representation of a UI component that may appear
 *     in the clientâ€™s browser. It is responsible for managing its identity, hierarchical ownership
 *     (via parent), and communication with the client through update instructions and event
 *     handling.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *     Every widget is associated with a {@link Client} instance and is assigned a globally
 *     unique {@link UId}. Widgets automatically register themselves in the client's widget
 *     registry upon creation.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *     This class is intended to be subclassed to implement concrete widget types such as buttons,
 *     input fields, containers, etc.
